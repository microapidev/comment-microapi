## <a name="contributing-your-code"></a> Contributing Your Code

Ensure that you lint and test your code before submitting a pull request (PR). For more information on the contributing guidelines and tips on certain implementation details, please see the [contributing documentation](https://github.com/microapi/comment-microapi/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## <a name="endpoints-documentation"></a> Endpoints Documentation

There are two options that you can choose from when you would like to view the endpoints' Swagger documentation.

The first option is online and should be your first go to as this will be the live server with the most trustworthy documentation.

The second option is local and should be used as a last resort when the online option is unavailable.

### Locally

After setting up your local environment (see above), please visit the `localhost:4000` or the `localhost:4000/documentation` route to see the local Swagger documentation.
